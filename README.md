# Advanced C++ Programs for College Students

This repository contains a set of advanced C++ programs designed for college students. These programs focus on more complex topics such as object-oriented programming (OOP), algorithms, recursion, data structures, and file handling. They are perfect for students looking to deepen their understanding of C++ and computer science concepts.

## Programs Included

1. **Student Management System with Classes**
   - A program that manages a list of students using classes and vectors. It handles user input and displays student details.

2. **Merge Sort Algorithm**
   - Implementation of the Merge Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers efficiently.

3. **Library Management System with File Handling**
   - A simulation of a library management system that allows users to add books and save the data to a file.

4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**
   - A program that implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) with insertion and search operations.

5. **Towers of Hanoi Problem (Recursion)**
   - A solution to the classic Towers of Hanoi problem using recursion.
